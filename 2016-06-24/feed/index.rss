					<description><![CDATA[Happy Birthday Lindsay. Finally 26 and I remember when I was 26th. Started my first blog. lol 

Ok, coffee needs to be made for me, still half asleep and forgot to write down a blog idea I had last night. Missing the details.  Over-all for the Genesis community was another great week.  

To be honest, I visited Canada once with family when I was 5 years ago and never been outside the USA ever again. My goal in life is to travel and blog and it can be reachable.  Will be hanging out on twitter watching more Genesis news unfold.]]></description>
