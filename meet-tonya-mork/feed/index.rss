					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://genesiswp.guide/meet-tonya-mork/#comment-420&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt;.

Hello Paul,

Thank you for your kind words.  I know you know the challenges that life can present toss in your path.  We are not powerless and can make choices, even if those choices are to simply smile and be happy in spite of it all.

You are on a path to be a more awesome developer.  You made the decision to focus on continuous learning and improvement.  Incrementally, step-by-step, you are getting better and better.  I&#039;m honored to help you grow in this profession.

I wish much success, happiness, and joy to you and your family. Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since meeting you last year - speaking with you both by video and text, I have had the honor of hearing your abbreviated story and now a more detailed account.  I admit that my own story resonates and I totally understand being humbled and the humility of having a &#039;handicap&#039; - 

Tonya, you are a unique individual and it has been a great joy learning under your direction. In fact, I have all of my browsers set to open to knowthecode.io so that I do not go a day without learning, relearning or refreshing this craft.

WordPress has been a huge blessing my family and I and I continue to grow in a career in web development.  First understanding the difference between and implementer and a coder. 

I know I can count on you to fight the good fight, share your vast &#038; proven knowledge and wisdom.  Know that you are fulfilling your mission in phase three.

May the Lord bless you with all that you ask for.]]></description>
