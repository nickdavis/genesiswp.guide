					<description><![CDATA[Hey Nick,

Thank you for including Know the Code and the shout out on the new book I&#039;m writing: 

Be a More Awesome Developer
Roadmap to Continuously Level Up in WordPress.  

I&#039;m asked so often how to level up in web development.  It&#039;s a natural transition to capture my experiences and put them into a resource for everyone.  The book will give you a roadmap of &quot;level up&quot; habit and techniques you can use at various stages in your professional career.  Plus I&#039;ll be throwing in some self-assessment tools too.  One of my goals is to then use the book as a companion resource for what I&#039;m doing at Know the Code.

As you know, I advocate that Genesis is &quot;the developer&#039;s theming framework.&quot;  (And nope, I don&#039;t work for StudioPress, i.e. Rainmaker, and I wasn&#039;t paid to say that either.) So I really get excited each week to see how folks in our community are using and building solution around it. 

This guide is where I go to catch up on the happenings in our community.  Keep up the good work!

Cheers and happy coding,
Tonya]]></description>
